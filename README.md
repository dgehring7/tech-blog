# tech-blog


## Description
This is a project/app that allows the user to create blog posts and then comment on other posts to the page.


## Usage
Upon entering the page, the user will be asked to log into the page. Once that has happened they should see any previous posts that have been written and be able to leave their own comments on them.
The user should then be able to enter their own blog post 
This is a blog building project that allows people to post blogs about any topic, and allows other users to comment on those posts
We will use the endpoints: GET, POST, and DELETE to view the data
While this is not completed, I will come back and get these routes to work. The biggest one that is not working is the GET route for the create a blog section
